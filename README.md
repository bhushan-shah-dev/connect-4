# Connect-4

This is a web version of the popular game [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four), built using [React](https://reactjs.org/).

Right now it only supports a 2-player mode on the same device.

## How it works

This is a Node.js application, built using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This will start the app in the development mode, accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Further documentation, including additional commands, is available [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
